# Image Assets (Lab 2 — Transfer Learning / GoogLeNet)

This folder stores image assets related to **Lab 2 (Transfer Learning with GoogLeNet)**.

## What’s inside?

### 1) Extracted figures from the Lab 2 PDF
Files named like:
- `embedded_p01_01.png`
- `embedded_p02_01.jpeg`
- `page_01.png`, `page_02.png`, ...

These were extracted from the Lab 2 technical report for documentation, reproducibility, and reference.

### 2) (Optional) Example figures generated by your code
If you export results (training plots, confusion matrix screenshots, prediction grids), you may also store them here.
However, for a clean repo, it’s better to store generated results in:
- `../outputs/`

## Notes
- Avoid spaces in filenames (use `_`).
- Keep naming consistent.
- If you upload the full page renders (`page_*.png`), they are large—feel free to keep only the `embedded_*` images if you prefer a lightweight repo.

## Source / Credit
Figures labeled `embedded_*` or `page_*` originate from the lab technical report and are included for educational and reproducibility purposes.
